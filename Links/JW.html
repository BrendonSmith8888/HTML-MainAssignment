    <h1>Jurrasic Park/World</h1>
    <p> Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional island of Isla
        Nublar, located off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. A successful theme park of cloned dinosaurs, dubbed
        Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing John Hammond's dream to fruition. The park
        plunges into chaos when a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage, while a
        conspiracy orchestrated by the park's staff creates more dangers.</p>
