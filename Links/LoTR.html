    <h1>Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit</h1>
    <p>The Hobbit is set within Tolkien's fictional universe and follows the quest of home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the
        titular hobbit, to win a share of the treasure guarded by a dragon named Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from
        his light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.</p>
    <p> The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in
        Middle-earth, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power
        given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the
        Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the
        quest to destroy the One Ring.</p>
