    <h1>Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth</h1>
    <p>The Battle for Middle-earth is a real-time strategy game. Warring factions gather resources, then use them to
        construct military bases and armies on-site. In The Battle for Middle-earth, buildings may only be constructed
        on the building slots of predefined plots. Plots range from farmhouses to full-fledged castles, with different
        slot arrangements and available buildings, and plots can be purchased when they're in the sole presence of a
        side's forces. The only resource are the nebulous "resources," which are produced inexhaustibly in dedicated
        buildings. Four factions on two sides wage the War of the Ring: Representing the Free Peoples are the
        horse-lords of Rohan, and Gondor with its forges and battlements. The Forces of Darkness are the fighting
        Uruk-hai of Isengard, and Mordor's orc hordes, bolstered by Haradrim, MÃ»makil, and Trolls.</p>
