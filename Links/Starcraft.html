    <h1>Starcraft</h1>
    <p>StarCraft is a military science fiction media franchise created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney and owned by
        Blizzard Entertainment. The series, set in the beginning of the 26th century, centers on a galactic struggle
        for dominance among four species—the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the
        powerful and enigmatic Protoss, and the godlike Xel'Naga creator race—in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy
        known as the Koprulu Sector. The series debuted with the video game StarCraft in 1998. It has grown to include a
        number of other games as well as eight novelizations, two Amazing Stories articles, a board game, and other
        licensed merchandise such as collectible statues and toys.

        Blizzard Entertainment began planning StarCraft in 1995 with a development team led by Metzen and Phinney. The
        game debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo and used a modified Warcraft II game engine. StarCraft
        also marked the creation of Blizzard Entertainment's film department; the game introduced high quality
        cinematics integral to the storyline of the series. Most of the original development team for StarCraft returned
        to work on the game's expansion pack, Brood War; that game's development began only shortly after StarCraft was
        released. In 2001, StarCraft: Ghost began development under Nihilistic Software. Unlike the previous real-time
        strategy games in the series, Ghost was to be a stealth-action game. After three years of development, work on
        the game was postponed in 2004. Development of a true RTS sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, began in 2003;
        the game was announced in May 2007 and was released in July 2010. StarCraft II continued with the StarCraft II:
        Heart of the Swarm expansion, which was released in March 2013. The third and final StarCraft II installment,
        Legacy of the Void, was released in November 2015. In 2016, a single-player nine-mission pack, Nova Covert Ops,
        was released in form of DLC.</p>
