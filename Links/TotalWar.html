    <h1>Total War - Warhammer</h1>
    <p>Total War: Warhammer is a turn-based strategy and real-time tactics video game developed by Creative Assembly and
        published by Sega for Microsoft Windows via the Steam gaming platform. The game was brought to macOS and Linux
        by Feral Interactive. The game features the gameplay of the Total War series with factions of Games Workshop's
        Warhammer Fantasy series; it is the first Total War game not to portray a historical setting. It is the 10th
        title in the Total War series and the first title to be released in the Total War: Warhammer trilogy.[1]

        Like previous titles in the Total War series, gameplay unfolds both on a scale of kingdoms in a turn-based
        strategy campaign, managing cities and the movement of armies, and on a smaller scale in real-time tactics
        skirmishes and sieges, managing the movement and actions of individual units and characters within an army
        during a battle. The player controls one of several fantasy factions, each with their own units, characters and
        abilities. These include Dwarfs, Human factions, Greenskins and Vampire Counts at launch, with more added as
        paid downloadable content.</p>
